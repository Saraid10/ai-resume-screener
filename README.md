## ## üéØ About The Project

In today's competitive job market, recruiters often receive hundreds of resumes for a single position. Manually screening these documents is time-consuming, tedious, and prone to human bias.

This AI-Powered Resume Screener is designed to solve that problem. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP), the tool can quickly analyze and score multiple resumes against a job description, providing a ranked list of the most qualified candidates. This allows hiring managers to focus their time and attention on the best fits for the role.

### ## ‚ú® Features

-   **Job Description Input:** A simple text area to paste the job description.
-   **Multiple Resume Uploads:** Supports uploading multiple PDF resumes at once.
-   **NLP-Based Scoring:** Uses TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity to calculate a relevance score for each resume.
-   **Ranked Results:** Displays a clean, sorted table of candidates from best to worst match.
-   **Score Visualization:** Includes a bar chart for an intuitive visual comparison of candidate scores.
